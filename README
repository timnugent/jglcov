Inverse covariance estimation using the joint graphical lasso [bioinformatics]

(c) Tim Nugent 2014

Installation
============

Requires R version 3. On Ubuntu, install:

r-base
r-base-dev

If compiling R from source, use the --enable-R-shlib flag.

Once installed, add the following packages:

> install.packages("corpcor")
> install.packages("igraph")
> install.packages("Rcpp")
> install.packages("RInside")

Details:

http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/corpcor/index.html
http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/igraph/index.html
http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html
http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RInside/index.html

Next tar/gzip up the JGLx directory which contains a modified version of the JGL package, then install:

> install.packages("JGLx.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type="source")

The modification allows you to pass a pXp covariance matrix rather than an nXp data matrix. 

Details and license:

http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/JGL/index.html

Then compile the main program with 'make'. This should link to R/Rcpp/RInside shared libraries and find the necessary headers.

Then run with:

jglcov demo.aln

See source code for command line options.

Warning - experimental code still under development!
